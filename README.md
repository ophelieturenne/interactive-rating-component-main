## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge (interactive rating component).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
